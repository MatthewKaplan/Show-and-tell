				Starting from the main trailhead at Chautauqua, this <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/osmp/chautauqua-trailhead" target="_blank">trail</a> ascends towards the majestic flatirons. Try to peel your eyes away from these awe-inspiring geologic formations enough to watch your step. This is one of the most used trails in the whole park so it is wide and mostly smooth. As you gain elevation, take a look back to the east and admire Boulder from above.<br><br>

				This trail runs straight through the heart of Chautauqua meadows. Due to the proximity of the parking lot and other infrastructure, you will most likely only see various birds, most of which will be Magpies. The tall grasses of the meadow give this trail an enchanted feel.<br><br>

				If you want to continue futher up to the Flatirons this trail provides access to Ski Jump Trail, Bluebell-Baird Trail and the Flatirons Loop Trail.<br><br>

				The views at the top of this strenuous <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/st-mary-s-glacier" target="_blank">trail</a> are well worth the high altitude hike. The trail goes from wide enough for a jeep to narrower with more numerous individual trails branching off through the woods. They all end up coming back together on the east side of Saint Mary's Lake. From there, take the bridge to cross the stream near the dam and continue up to the glacier.<br><br>

				It is about a mile hike from the lake to the glacier. From there, the trail continues approximately another mile up to a junction with Kingson Peak. Spectacular views of the area can be enjoyed along the whole journey, but the junction with the Kingston Peak Trail will provide the best photo ops.<br><br>

				This <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/flatirons-vista-trail" target="_blank">trail</a> is fairly straightforward - it's mostly flat and full of small, and sometimes loose rocks. At the end of the Doudy Draw trail, this trail begins mostly south through fairly open forest. You'll catch interesting viewpoints through the trees as you move along.<br><br>

				The trail loops around back to the east and eventually northeast all the way to the eastern end of Flatirons Vista North. From this high point, there are expansive views out over the plains. The option also exists to cross highway 93 here to meet up with the east Marshall Mesa trail system.

				<strong>Length:</strong> 3.5 Miles<br>
				<strong>Ascent:</strong> 285'<br>
				<strong>Distance from Turing:</strong> 24 Miles/29 Minutes
