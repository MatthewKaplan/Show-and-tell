				<a href="https://www.bluebirdtheater.net/" target="_blank">The Bluebird Theater</a> was built in 1913 and originally named after the prominent Denver grocer and druggist, John Thompson. The theater was renamed in 1922 and became an important part of the community. The theater was also initially a movie house and went through various phases over the years. In 1994, Chris Swank and Evan Dechtman invested in the Bluebird and it re-opened as a live music venue, as it remains today. The theater is laid out in tiers with a balcony overlooking the entire space. In 2006, AEG Live took over the Bluebird Theater and made significant upgrades.<br><br>

				The Bluebird Theater is operated by AEG Live. AEG Live, the live-entertainment division of Los Angeles-based AEG, is dedicated to all aspects of live contemporary music performance, touring for a variety of programming, and multi-media production. AEG Live, the nation's second-largest concert promotion and touring company, is comprised of special event, broadcast and exhibition divisions, fourteen regional offices, and numerous state-of-the-art venues nationwide. AEG Live has an international reach with regional and local presence in San Diego, New York, Las Vegas, London, Nashville, Houston, Dallas, St. Louis, Atlanta, Denver, San Francisco, Florida, and Los Angeles.

				<a href="https://www.ogdentheatre.com/" target="_blank">The Ogden Theatre</a> was opened in 1919 by John Thompson, who also ran the Thompson (later Bluebird) Theater. The Ogden Theatre originally hosted live performances such as weekly organ recitals, dances, lectures and vaudeville acts - most notably, the legendary Harry Houdini. By 1937 it had been converted to a movie theater that featured everything from the classics to the avant garde. In the '80's it was a revival house that featured the cult movie classic, The Rocky Horror Picture Show every Saturday night. The inside and outside of the Ogden Theatre have been renovated many times throughout the years, as well as a host of different marquee signs have been used. The flat marquee on the theater was added during a major remodel in the 1970s and was upgraded in 1993.<br><br>

				In the late 1980s, ownership of the theater changed hands numerous times until the theater was closed in 1990. The theatre was marked for demolition until Doug Kauffman of the independent live music promoter Nobody In Particular Presents purchased the building in 1992. Kauffman's vision was to turn the Ogden Theater into a premier music venue.<br><br>

				The Ogden Theatre was re-opened in 1993 featuring a wide variety of live performances. The theatre found its niche and has become a premier concert venue in Denver featuring approximately 150 concerts per year. In 2006, NIPP leased the venue to AEG Live.

				<a href="https://www.cervantesmasterpiece.com/" target="_blank">Cervantes' Masterpiece Ballroom</a> is located at 2637 Welton Street in the old Casino Cabaret whose history dates back to the Cotton Club days of the 1930s when jazz greats such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman took the stage when they toured through Denver. Over the years the Casino Cabaret has hosted such acts as James Brown, BB King, Ray Charles, Ike & Tina Turner, and countless others. Cervantes' has continued the musical legacy of the building and neighborhood ever since the grand opening in January 2003.<br><br>

				Cervantes' has two rooms that offer live music simultaneously, Cervantes' and The Other Side. Each room operates independently of the other but they are connected giving our patrons the ability to venture back and forth between each room. Cervantes' Masterpiece Ballroom separates itself from other Denver live music venues for a multitude of reasons, but the dual venue feature makes Cervantes' stand out the most.<br><br>

				Cervantes' holds 900 people and includes a balcony that wraps around the entire room creating a very intimate setting. Cervantes' incorporates a top of the line sound system, including a Meyer MICALine Array with four boxes per side and six Meyer 650P subs. This arrangement translates into full sound that can be heard throughout the venue from front to back. The Other Side holds 500 people and has equally impressive traits.

				<a href="https://www.gothictheatre.com/" target="_blank">The Gothic Theatre</a> is a former movie theatre, the first in Denver to show "talkies,"" turned music venue. Originally built in the 1920's The Gothic Theatre's grand art deco style provides an extraordinary and beautiful background. Though the front facade was altered in the 1940s to keep pace with modern tastes of the times, when renovated in 1998 the historic interior was kept as the venue was rebuilt from top to bottom and fitted to become a premier part of Colorado music.<br><br>

				On June 23, 1999, when the very appropriate legends of New Orleans, The Rebirth Brass Band, took the stage, the glorious Gothic Theatre was back in the business of making memories. Since then the Gothic Theatre has hosted many distinguished shows. Local bands as well as nationally recognized bands continue to showcase their talent at the venue.<br><br>

				The Gothic is located on Denver's historic South Broadway Street, and has a capacity of just less than 1000. It offers a full bar, a standing room only section as well as a seated section. All tickets, however, are sold as general admission. Included in the theater is a 20-foot retractable movie screen with a projector. The stage is 25 feet by 18 feet, with 19 feet of space from the stage to the lighting truss. Despite liquor being banned at all ages concerts in the city of Denver, The Gothic can still sell alcohol at all of their shows due to their Englewood location.
