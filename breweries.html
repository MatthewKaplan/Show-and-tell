				<a href="http://denverbeerco.com/" target="_blank">Denver Beer Co.</a> was born in our garages with a few batches of home brew and a love for the craft of brewing. Serving only premium artisan ales and lagers, we utilize fresh ingredients and embrace both innovative and old world styles of beer. Similar to a farmer's table, our beer selections change with the seasons. By brewing in small batches, we can ensure that a few old favorites are always on tap, but new goodies greet visitors each month.<br><br>

				Our brewery is founded on passion for high quality, flavorfully crafted beer and the belief that the best pints are those shared with good company. Drawing inspiration from beer gardens of Bavaria, we designed Denver Beer Co. to be a place where new and old friends can share a table and pint out of doors.

				During the late 80s, Brian Dunn spent 5 years overseas building farms in developing countries.  Having grown up in a family that valued good food and drink, Dunn grew his knowledge and passion for beer during his travels.  Dunn eventually returned to Colorado, started homebrewing and went to graduate school.  Upon graduation in 1993, when the Denver beer scene barely existed, he set out to found what would eventually become one of America's most decorated and celebrated craft breweries.<br><br>

				<a href="https://greatdivide.com/" target="_blank">Great Divide Brewery</a> started small and in the beginning Dunn was the only full-time employee: brewing, bottling and selling to accounts all in the same day.  As the brewery grew, the beer spoke for itself.  Dunn's beers were balanced, flavorful and representative of a lifestyle that is uniquely Colorado.  While Great Divide's ethos may be globally-inspired, our beers are distinctly Denver.<br><br>

				Since 1994 we've brewed all sorts of exciting beer styles, added lots of brewing capacity and we've assembled a great staff.  In 2001, we bought our building - which used to be an old dairy processing plant - and set out for over a decade of exponential growth. In 2011, we realized we would soon outgrow our space and began looking for land to expand- knowing that leaving the city was not an option.

				Founded in Denver, CO in late 2010 as an artisan beer project, <a href="http://www.crookedstave.com/" target="_blank">Crooked Stave</a> is the culmination of brewmaster and "Brettanomyces Guru" Chad Yakobson's open source Master's research, The Brettanomyces Project. Crooked Stave's progressive approach to brewing blends science and art through creativity and passion. The resulting creations, most of which use Brettanomyces yeasts and mature in oak, are beers of extraordinary complexity.<br><br>

				As a modern artisan brewery with a quality driven focus, we strive to progressively blend science and art through creativity and following our passion. We are committed to operating as a profitable and sustainable brewery, which spurs innovation through encouraging the sharing of ideas in an open environment, a commitment that is further reflected through our marketing and community involvement.<br><br>

				From our humble beginnings, we embraced creativity while always striving to make quality our focus. Today we are proud to say we work closely with many of the farmers and skilled craftsmen who produce the ingredients we regularly use. We periodically brew with Colorado floor malted barley as our base malt, we feature Colorado grown hops in various recipes and work meticulously with whole fruit and only whole fruit, most of which is grown in Colorado. This attention to detail and stewardship for the land produces beers of extraordinary quality and is unmistakable in everything we produce.

				In many ways, <a href="http://ratiobeerworks.com/" target="_blank">Ratio</a> started in the punk scene back in the late 90's. We cut our teeth by touring, playing out, creating zines, and working at labels. That DIY mindset prepared us for the challenges of creating and sharing our passions on our own terms. Over the years that energy has been channeled into brewing, learning the craft in Germany and honing our skills at some of the most respected breweries in Colorado. After moving on to successful careers in brewing, marketing, and finance; we have teamed up again for our most ambitious project yet - Ratio Beerworks, a Denver micro brewery.<br><br>

				With a state of the art 20 barrel system, our Denver microbrewery has more than enough beer to go around. And the tap room will be as eclectic as the community that it's built to support. The scene at Ratio is all about beer, but our art and music programs will ensure all of the senses are stimulated.

				In 1988 LoDo had no ballpark, no valet parking, no farm-to-table restaurants. Just four guys who wanted to make really good beer.<br><br>
				Those four guys were John Hickenlooper, Jerry Williams, Mark Schiffler and Russell Schehrer. They opened the first craft Brewery in Denver on Skid Row in the century-old J. S. Brown Mercantile Building.<br><br>

				They built a bar by the building's old vault, and another bar in the back of the building's expansive showroom. They installed a small brewhouse on the main floor. They placed 22 pool tables on the second floor and called it Wynkoop Billiards.<br><br>

				Beer drinkers across the state braved the sketchy ghost town that was LoDo in the late 80's for billiards and pints of Russell's unexpected beer styles. He was one of the first professional brewers in the country to try his hand at mead-making, doppel alt, and cream stout. He was honored by the Brewers Association when he passed with the Russell Schehrer. Award for Innovation in Brewing, awarded each year at the Craft Brewers Conference to a brewer who knocks down doors.<br><br>

				Almost thirty years later, <a href="https://wynkoop.com/" target="_blank"> Wynkoop Brewing Company</a> is a Denver institution, still known for innovative, ballsy brewers who put just about anything in their beer, including Rocky Mountain oysters, gummy bears and green chiles. It's known as the brewery that brewed a neighborhood because-without exaggeration-the Wynkoop helped catalyze the revitalization of LoDo.
