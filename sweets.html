				<a href="http://www.littlemanicecream.com/" target="_blank">Little Man Ice Cream</a> is named after founder Paul Tamburello's father, Peter Tamburello (nicknamed Little Man). Although small in stature, he was big in heart and making a difference in the world was his legacy. Little Man Ice Cream is Paul's way of keeping his father's legacy resilient.<br><br>

				Inspired by vintage Coney Island hot dog-shaped stands, business is conducted within a twenty-eight foot tall, 14,000 lb. cream can. Little Man Ice Cream is all about the EXPERIENCE! The customer's experience is one of pure nostalgia nestled in the 21st Century. In the golden era of the great American road trip during the 1920s-1950s, unique American food items like donuts, hot dogs, or ice cream were celebrated and memorialized by roadside monuments built to expand on the food experience itself. How better to enjoy a scoop of ice cream than one out of a 28ft tall cream can!? The Little Man experience is a loving tribute to the creativity, wonderment, and whimsy of that era.<br><br>

				Beyond the whimsy, Little Man Ice Cream also builds on the time honored tradition of the neighborhood ice cream store. From the great flavors of homemade ice creams & hand-crafted novelties, to the aroma of fresh waffle cones cooked on site, to a lively cobblestone plaza that plays host to a variety of events-it is Little Man's goal set itself apart by engaging all of the customer's senses.

				Who'd have thought that the hottest spot on SoBo would serve ice cream? When Samantha Kopicko and Chia Basinger opened their storefront spot in 2009, they just wanted to serve up the very best homemade ice cream they could, using milk and cream from local dairies and spices from Savory Spice Shop to create dozens of truly cool new flavors -- including the incredible Stranahan's Whiskey Brickle. But in the process, they've become a must-stop for all the hipsters heading out for a night on the town.<br><br>

				<a href="https://www.sweetactionicecream.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Action Ice Cream</a> is made by hand with the finest ingredients. We start with fresh natural Colorado dairy, and then we work with local purveyors, farmers, and bakers to source Colorado's best produce and products for our ice cream. It is our priority to run a sustainable business, and Sweet Action Ice Cream is entirely powered by wind. We use compostable and recyclable packaging in our ice cream shop.

				<a href="https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/" target="_blank">Voodoo Doughnut</a> in Portland Oregon, Eugene Oregon, Denver Colorado, Austin Texas, and now L.A. California, was the brain child of Kenneth "Cat Daddy" Pogson and Tres Shannon who had been friends for a while. They always wanted to start a business together. Something that would fit into an extraordinary Portland Oregon business climate. Something fun, different, and one for the ages.<br><br>

				After flying in some "Voodoo Oil" from down south, acquiring the nuts and bolts of their shop, the boys started tinkering around with their methods that soon became known locally, nationally, and worldwide. People have talked about Voodoo Doughnut in Tibet, on Easter Island, Japan has some stylish folks sporting the latest Voodoo underpants, and friends have shared a buttermilk bar in Tanzania. I'm sure some corners of the globe have yet to be penetrated. Stay tuned!
