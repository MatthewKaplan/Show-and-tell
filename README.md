# Turing Denver 

I created this webpage as a part of the Prework for Turing. I decided to create a webpage where people can go to see my favorite things to do in and around Denver. All of the links work but I'll only be supplying an example of one below so if you would like to see my other recommendations download/clone this repo and open `index.html` in the browser of your choise. Thanks for checking out my first webpage attempt pre-turing.
