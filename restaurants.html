				Sam Armatas opened the first <a href="https://samsno3.com/" target="_blank">Sam's No. 3</a> at 15th and Curtis streets in 1927 - just not where the current Sam's No. 3 stands at 15th and Curtis. The original was across the street, on the Federal Reserve Bank side, but when the Fed bought the block, Armatas moved Sam's across the street. It began as a tiny, 19-stool soda fountain-style counter that sold mostly hot dogs, burgers and red chili. Armatas ran other Sam's soda fountains, too: Sam's 1-4 and Sam's Coney Island. Lucky No. 3 is the only iteration to have survived. Ninety-one years later, the diner is still all in the family, with (the original) Sam's son Spero and grandsons Sam, Patrick and Alex running the restaurants.<br><br>

				There is nothing quite like a light, buttery biscuit straight from the oven. A staple to the Southern diet, at one point in time it was nearly impossible to sit down for a meal without finding biscuits at the table. In theory, biscuits are pretty straightforward, made with simple ingredients like flour, baking soda and powder, buttermilk, butter, and salt; but despite their simplicity, there are countless recipes that are handed down from generation to generation, all with slight variances and diehard flour preferences. But as with everything else, there is always room for improvement.<br><br>

				While the restaurant serves many classic biscuits, including a plain biscuit with butter, biscuits and gravy and shrimp and grits, there are also some more unique dishes and sandwiches, such as biscuit French toast and the DBC Club (a biscuit with buttermilk fried chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle ranch). "I love a straight up biscuit out of the oven", Shader responded when asked what his favorite biscuit style was. "The shrimp and grits is really good, too. It's well rounded. But the biscuit is a great vessel for any sandwich. I developed stuff that I want to eat."<br><br>

				The original <a href="www.eatmorejelly.com" target="_blank">Jelly</a> opened in Capitol Hill early in 2011 and was packed from the start. Jelly owners Christina Smith and Josh Epps, veterans of the San Francisco restaurant scene, were right when they thought they saw a gap in Denver's breakfast culture; today, Jelly's popularity shows no signs of abating. In fact, the concept is doing so well that in 2012, Epps and Smith opened this second Jelly in the University of Denver neighborhood, which has the same hip ambience, the same hung-over hipster crowd, the same clever cocktails -- and the same impressive menu of breakfast and lunch items.

				<a href="www.mountainsunpub.com" target="_blank">Vine Street Pub</a>, one of the Mountain Sun spots, has been brewing its own beer since 2012, which makes it a particularly welcome hangout in Denver's City Park neighborhood. The five pubs are a front for a microbrewery, and they each maintain a line of about twenty taps for the Sun's own solid, award-winning craft beers. During happy hour, hippies, hikers and lawn-game enthusiasts can indulge in $3 pints of heady IPAs and nitro stouts, supplemented by bar fare that pragmatically provides both bacon and beer-baked tempeh for the eclectic group of eaters who frequent these establishments.

				Former Rioja and Bistro Vendome employees Dana Rodriguez (the chef) and Tony Maciag (the front-of-house specialist) envisioned something egalitarian when they opened <a href="https://workandclassdenver.com/" target="_blank">Work & Class</a> in 2014 in a space built from shipping containers. Loud and lively, the eatery leans heavily on the chef's Mexican upbringing - cochinita pibil and slow-cooked goat are customer favorites - while also embracing regional American cooking, from fried trout and Cajun-spiced chicken to cornbread and biscuits. The drinks flow freely and the eats come to the table in tin pans, without much fuss or adornment. But every bite is as vibrant and alive as the space itself.

				<a href="https://izakayaden.net/" target="_blank">Izakaya Den</a> is Denver's popular Japanese gastro pub serving global cuisine. The restaurant is located on South Pearl Street and is the second restaurant of the founder of Sushi Den. The menu is global cuisine style, serving traditional Japanese plates along with dishes infused with international flavors.<br><br>

				Our typical day at the restaurant is long, so before heading home, there is nothing better than winding down by visiting a great spot where we can grab a quick bite and a drink. Izakaya literally means "Sake House with small plates" and you will find Izakaya pubs all over Japan. It is a place where locals go to let loose after a hard day's work. Like the traditional sake dens of Japan, Izakaya Den is a wonderful place to sit and contemplate your work day. For those who love Slow Food, Izakaya Den offers the chance to stretch out your dining experience, enjoy each bite, every carefully balanced flavor, every drop of liquid genius, disguised as sauce.

				Brother-and-sister team Paul and Aileen Reilly couldn't have picked a better spot for <a href="http://copertadenver.com/" target="_blank">Coperta</a>, their Italian followup to Beast + Bottle. Its location across from Benedict Fountain Park means that after a leisurely meal, you can walk out the door, belly full of wine and pasta and cheese, and engage in that most Italian of traditions: the passeggiata, or evening stroll. Prior to launch, the pair traveled widely throughout Rome and points south, and came home with a menu that includes several knockout dishes, including chewy cavatelli with meat ragu, bucatini all'amatriciana with salty nubs of guanciale, and polenta, which defies its humble origins with a richness that comes from butter and leftover whey. Chicken isn't always the most exciting dish on a menu, but Coperta's pollo allo diavolo makes you reconsider that assumption: Diavolo means "devil", and this wood-charred half-chicken lives up to its name, fiery from its chile marinade, Calabrian chiles and the red-tinged chile oil ringing the plate. The Reillys have brought interesting touches to their newest restaurant, such as spuzzulia, a chef's-choice selection of off-menu nibbles, and a mozzarella bar, which allows you to build your own cheese plate with add-ons from Sienese peppers to fig vincotto.
